# Time Series Analysis with ARIMA Model

This project performs time series analysis on a dataset of air passengers using Python. It includes data visualization, stationarity tests, decomposition, and ARIMA modeling to forecast future trends.

## 📌 Features
- Load and preprocess time series data
- Perform stationarity tests (Dickey-Fuller test)
- Apply rolling statistics and exponential smoothing
- Decompose time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals
- Plot ACF and PACF graphs
- Build AR, MA, and ARIMA models for forecasting

## 🛠️ Requirements
Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
